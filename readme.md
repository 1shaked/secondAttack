# Chat App Security Audit

Welcome to the Chat App Security Audit Task! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to identify any potential security vulnerabilities in the chat application.

## Introduction

A chat application has been developed and is stored in a secret file. Your initial task is to locate this file. Once you've found it and logged in, your main objective will be to scrutinize the application for potential security risks.

## Steps

1. **Locate the Secret File**
    - The chat application codebase is hidden in a clandestine file.
    - Hint: Remember the file searching techniques we discussed in class.

2. **Login to the Chat App**
    - Once you locate the file, find a way to log in to the chat application.
    - Hint: Credentials might be hidden, hardcoded, or require some form of extraction. Think about the authentication methods we've learned.

3. **Security Audit**
    - Examine the application for any potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Utilize the materials and techniques we've studied in class to guide your investigation.
    - Remember to look for:
        - SQL Injections
        - Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
        - Broken Authentication
        - Sensitive Data Exposure
        - and more...

## Reporting

Once you've concluded your security audit:

1. Document each vulnerability you've discovered.
2. Describe its potential impact.
3. Provide recommended mitigation strategies.

## Resources

- Refer back to the class materials for insights into common vulnerabilities and their countermeasures.
- Use any tools or scripts we've used during our sessions, but always remember to act responsibly and ethically.

## Conclusion

The main goal of this task is to practice and enhance your security auditing skills. The world of cybersecurity is vast, and the threats are ever-evolving. By simulating real-world scenarios like this, you're not only testing your knowledge but also preparing for genuine security challenges.

Good luck, and may you find every loophole!
